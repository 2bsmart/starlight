# Contributing to Starlight

As an auditor, EY has to comply with strict procedures to ensure that we maintain independence from any organisations we audit. Accordingly, we would be very grateful to receive PRs for bug fixes or efficiency improvements to the existing code. New features should be added by forking this repository.

The requirement to maintain independence is also the reason that we have waived all copyright and placed the code in the public domain, rather than using a more conventional open source licensing approach.

## Branch policy

The [master branch](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/starlight/tree/master) is a supported version per our [security policy](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/starlight/security/policy). Please make all pull requests against this version, unless you have a specific reason to branch off of another branch.

## Commit policy

We will prefer if your commit messages can please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. Some examples of good commit messages include:

- `feat(code): proofs presented in more compact form`
- `fix: remove appending of '1' to inputs`
- `refactor(parser): new api used`

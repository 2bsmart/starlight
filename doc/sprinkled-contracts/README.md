Here are a couple of example contracts for inspiration.

- `Escrow.sol` - a simple escrow contract, that should transpile to a nightfall-like protocol.

- `VolumePurchaseProcess.sol` - a complex volume-purchase contract, that should transpile to a Radish35-like protocol. I haven't sprinkled privacy syntax over this yet. Hopefully it gives an indication of the monumental difficult of this project!
